#Open Orchestra Project
#######################


This tool written in python aim to create orchestra sfz sample bank from nice sharing.
The Philharmonia Orchestra based in London share samples from their musician :
  http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music
The Music departement of the University of Iowa share orchestra samples :
  http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html


So this tool download automatically all the samples (the zip package, not one by one...) from those website, 
uncompress package, transcode file to wav format, remove blank sound at the beginning of the file,
sort and parse all the samples by instrument and create sfz file.

!!!!!!!!!!
! You need SOX software to transcode
!!!!!!!!!!
and also python of course 
and python module requests


I use LinuxSampler as SFZ player:
http://linuxsampler.org

I should host the generated bank here:
http://klemxxiii.free.fr/


Let me know if there is problems or bad sample to remove.

The license of each sample provider is available in the output directory or in the main directory 
of this project. There are quite permissive !

#RUN
##########
  run :
    python open_orch.py uiowa.json (for University of Iowa samples)
    or
    python open_orch.py philharmonia.json (for the Philharmonia samples)

  output:
    SFZ bank will be created in UIowa_edu_sfz or Philharmonia_co_uk_sfz directory.

  temp dir:
   uiowa_tmp and phil_tmp are temporary directory with a lot of intermediate audio files.
   You can delete them if you need space, but keep them if you want to rerun the script and don't 
   want to download the samples again.
